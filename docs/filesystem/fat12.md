# FAT12

FAT12 is the primary read/write filesystem, stored on a 1.44 MB floppy disk. It is accessible as:
- Absolute paths under `/mnt/fat/`
- Bare filenames relative to the current working directory (cluster stored in `SYSTEM_CONFIG`)

---

## Hardware: Floppy Controller (`fs/fat12/block.rs`)

`Floppy` implements `BlockDevice` using direct ISA DMA and FDC I/O port programming.

### DMA Setup (`Floppy::init`)

Called before every read. Programs ISA DMA channel 2 to transfer one sector (512 bytes) from the floppy controller into the static `DMA: [u8; 512]` buffer:

```
port 0x0A ← 0x06   Mask channels 2+0
port 0x0C ← 0xFF   Reset flip-flop
port 0x04 ← addr_lo, addr_hi   DMA buffer address
port 0x05 ← 511 lo, 511 hi     Transfer count − 1
port 0x81 ← page               High byte of DMA address
port 0x0A ← 0x02               Unmask channel 2
```

The `DMA` buffer is placed in a `.dma` link section so its physical address is known at build time.

### Read Sector (`read_sector`)

1. Convert LBA → CHS: `C = LBA / (18 × 2)`, `H = (LBA % 36) / 18`, `S = (LBA % 18) + 1`.
2. Set DMA read mode (`port 0x0B ← 0x56`): single transfer, address increment, read, channel 2.
3. Send FDC READ DATA command (0x46) with head/cylinder/head/sector/byte-size/18/GAP3/DTL.
4. Wait for IRQ6 by polling `port 0x3F4` MSR bit 7, then send Sense Interrupt (0x08) and drain 7 result bytes.
5. `copy_nonoverlapping(DMA, buffer, 512)`.

The floppy disk geometry assumed throughout: 80 cylinders, 2 heads, 18 sectors/track = 1440 sectors × 512 bytes = 1.44 MB.

### Write Sector (`write_sector`)

1. Seeks to the target cylinder/head using FDC SEEK command (0x0F).
2. Reprograms DMA channel 2 for memory→device transfer (mode 0x58) with the data copied to `DMA_BUFFER_ADDR = 0x1000`.
3. Sends FDC WRITE DATA command (0x45).
4. Waits for IRQ6.

### FDC Ports

| Port | Register |
|------|---------|
| `0x3F2` | Digital Output Register (DOR) — motor, drive select |
| `0x3F4` | Main Status Register (MSR) — ready/busy flags |
| `0x3F5` | Data FIFO — command/result bytes |

## Filesystem Structure (`fs/fat12/fs.rs`)

`Filesystem<D: BlockDevice>` holds all computed layout values derived from the boot sector:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `device` | Reference to the underlying `BlockDevice` |
| `boot_sector` | Parsed copy of the BPB (sector 0) |
| `fat_start_lba` | LBA of FAT table (= `reserved_sectors`) |
| `root_dir_start_lba` | LBA of root directory region |
| `data_start_lba` | LBA of first data cluster |
| `sectors_per_cluster` | Sectors per cluster from BPB |

### Boot Sector / BPB (`fs/fat12/entry.rs`)

`BootSector` is `#[repr(C, packed)]`, read directly from sector 0:

| Offset | Field | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| 0 | `jmp` | 3-byte jump instruction |
| 3 | `oem` | OEM string (8 bytes) |
| 11 | `bytes_per_sector` | Always 512 |
| 13 | `sectors_per_cluster` | Sectors per allocation unit |
| 14 | `reserved_sectors` | Sectors before the FAT (usually 1) |
| 16 | `fat_count` | Number of FAT copies (usually 2) |
| 17 | `root_entry_count` | Max root directory entries (usually 224) |
| 19 | `total_sectors_16` | Total sectors on disk |
| 22 | `fat_size_16` | Sectors per FAT copy (usually 9) |

Detection: `Filesystem::new` scans the boot sector for the 5-byte string `"FAT12"`. If not found, returns `Err`.

### Layout Arithmetic

```
fat_start_lba      = reserved_sectors
root_dir_sectors   = ceil(root_entry_count × 32 / 512)
root_dir_start_lba = fat_start_lba + (fat_count × fat_size_16)
data_start_lba     = root_dir_start_lba + root_dir_sectors
cluster_to_lba(n)  = data_start_lba + (n − 2) × sectors_per_cluster
```

## Directory Entries (`fs/fat12/entry.rs`)

Each directory entry is 32 bytes (`#[repr(C, packed)]`):

| Offset | Size | Field | Description |
|--------|------|-------|-------------|
| 0 | 8 | `name` | Filename, space-padded, uppercase |
| 8 | 3 | `ext` | Extension, space-padded, uppercase |
| 11 | 1 | `attr` | Attribute flags (see below) |
| 12 | 1 | `reserved` | |
| 13 | 1 | `create_time_tenths` | |
| 14 | 2 | `create_time` | |
| 16 | 2 | `create_date` | |
| 18 | 2 | `last_access_date` | |
| 20 | 2 | `high_cluster` | High 16 bits of cluster (unused in FAT12) |
| 22 | 2 | `write_time` | |
| 24 | 2 | `write_date` | |
| 26 | 2 | `start_cluster` | First cluster of file data |
| 28 | 4 | `file_size` | File size in bytes (0 for directories) |

### Attribute Byte Flags

| Bit | Value | Meaning |
|-----|-------|---------|
| 0 | 0x01 | Read-only |
| 1 | 0x02 | Hidden |
| 2 | 0x04 | System |
| 3 | 0x08 | Volume label |
| 4 | 0x10 | Directory |
| 5 | 0x20 | Archive |

### Special First-Byte Values

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `0x00` | End of directory (no more entries) |
| `0xE5` | Deleted entry (slot is reusable) |
| `0xFF` | Unused (treated as invalid) |

---

## FAT Table Encoding (`fs/fat12/table.rs`, `fs/fat12/fs.rs`)

FAT12 encodes each cluster entry in 12 bits. Two cluster numbers share 3 bytes, packed as follows:

For an even cluster N at byte offset `fat_offset = (N * 3) / 2`:
```
value = byte[fat_offset] | ((byte[fat_offset+1] & 0x0F) << 8)
```

For an odd cluster N:
```
value = (byte[fat_offset] >> 4) | (byte[fat_offset+1] << 4)
```

### Special Cluster Values

| Range | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `0x000` | Free cluster |
| `0x001` | Reserved |
| `0x002–0xFEF` | Valid data cluster, value = next cluster in chain |
| `0xFF0–0xFF6` | Reserved |
| `0xFF7` | Bad sector |
| `0xFF8–0xFFF` | End of chain (EOF) |

`FatTable` reads all 9 FAT sectors (4608 bytes) into a single `[u8; 4608]` for batch inspection. `Filesystem::read_fat12_entry` reads individual sectors on demand, handling the cross-sector boundary case (when `fat_offset == 511`).

---

## Operations

### Read File (`read_file`)

Follows the cluster chain starting from `start_cluster`:
1. Convert cluster → LBA.
2. Read 512-byte sector into the caller's buffer at offset `count × 512`.
3. Advance to `read_fat12_entry(cluster)`.
4. Stop when chain entry ≥ `0xFF8` or buffer is exhausted.

### Write File (`write_file`)

1. If a file with the same name exists: `free_cluster_chain` its old clusters, mark its directory entry `0xE5`.
2. `allocate_cluster()`: scan FAT entries for `0x000` (free), mark it `0xFFF`, return its index.
3. Write each 512-byte sector of `data` into allocated clusters; `write_fat12_entry(cluster, next)` to chain them; mark the last cluster `0xFFF`.
4. `write_dir_entry()`: scan the directory for a free slot (`0x00` or `0xE5`), write the 32-byte entry (name, attr `0x20`, cluster, file_size).

### Delete File (`delete_file`)

Marks the first byte of the directory entry as `0xE5`. Does not free clusters (no garbage collection; on overwrite, `write_file` calls `free_cluster_chain` first).

### Rename File (`rename_file`)

Overwrites the 11 name bytes in the directory entry. Does not change cluster chain or file data.

### Create Subdirectory (`create_subdirectory`)

1. `allocate_cluster()` for the new directory.
2. Write a directory entry with `attr = 0x10`, `file_size = 0`.
3. Zero the cluster's sector.
4. Write `.` (self-pointer) and `..` (parent-pointer) entries into the new cluster.
5. Mark the new cluster as end-of-chain (`0xFFF`) in the FAT.

### Directory Traversal (`for_each_entry`)

Iterates all 32-byte entries in a directory, calling a closure for each:
- `dir_cluster == 0`: reads the fixed root directory region (`root_dir_start_lba`, `root_entry_count` entries).
- `dir_cluster > 0`: follows the FAT cluster chain for subdirectories.

### Path Lookup (`find_entry`, `resolve_path_from`)

`find_entry(cluster, name83)` calls `for_each_entry` and matches all 11 bytes (name + ext).

`resolve_path_from(start_cluster, path)` splits `path` on `/` and calls `find_entry` for each component, following directory cluster chains. Returns `None` if any component is missing. An empty path returns a synthetic directory entry for `start_cluster` itself.

---

## Filename Format (`fat83`)

`fat83(component)` converts a file name component (e.g. `b"file.txt"`) to the 11-byte FAT 8.3 format:

- Split at the last `.`; left side = name (max 8), right side = extension (max 3).
- Uppercase all bytes.
- Space-pad to `[u8; 11]`.

Example: `b"SH.ELF"` → `b"SH      ELF"`.

---

## Filesystem Check (`fs/fat12/check.rs`)

`run_check()` → `CheckReport { errors, orphan_clusters, cross_linked, invalid_entries }`:

1. `FatTable::load()` reads all 9 FAT sectors into a contiguous buffer.
2. `scan_directory(0, ...)` recursively visits every directory and file from the root (max depth 64):
   - Directories: recurse.
   - Files: `validate_chain` marks each cluster as visited in a `[bool; 4096]` bitmap, detects cross-linked clusters (already-visited cluster reused by a different file).
3. After scanning, counts orphan clusters: FAT entries that are non-zero (allocated) but were never visited by `scan_directory`.

Exposed via syscall `0x2B`. Returns four `u64` values written to a userland `FsckReport_T` struct.
